# MySQL Advanced PL/SQL Programming

This repository contains MySQL scripts demonstrating advanced database programming techniques inspired by PL/SQL concepts. Each script showcases a key aspect of MySQL procedural language capabilities for building dynamic and reliable database applications.

## üöÄ Features Covered

- **Stored Procedures:**  
  Encapsulate and execute complex logic and database operations efficiently.

- **Functions:**  
  Return computed values such as totals, averages, or status checks directly from SQL queries.

- **Cursors:**  
  Process query results row by row using explicit cursors within stored procedures.

- **Conditional Statements:**  
  Implement decision-making logic using `IF`, `CASE`, and related constructs.

- **Flow Control Statements:**  
  Control program execution using loops like `LOOP`, `WHILE`, and `REPEAT`.

- **Error / Exception Handling:**  
  Use `DECLARE HANDLER` for managing runtime issues such as missing data or invalid operations.

- **Triggers:**  
  Automate tasks by executing code before or after `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Software:** MySQL Workbench  
- **Language:** MySQL Procedural Language (PL/SQL-style syntax)

## üí° Learning Objectives
- Master MySQL stored routines and triggers.  
- Learn procedural extensions of SQL for automation and data processing.  
- Understand robust error handling and program flow control in MySQL.
